"""
Determine the fewest number of coins you can use to make a certain
amount if you have coins of a certain set of denominations. You can
use any quantity of each denomination and assume the denominations are
given in increasing order of value. Alternatives:

* Use one coin of the highest denomination, the number of coins used
  goes up by one.
* Donâ€™t use any coin of the highest denomination, move to next one
  and the number of coins used stays the same.

Recurrence relation: f(i, a) = min(f(i, a-d[i]) + 1, f(i-1, a)).
